# Hostinger 2.0 
## [Live Site](https://adityahostinger-english.netlify.app/)
Created the website using React js, Bootstrap and typedJs(package) for the hackathon held by the Thapa technical YT channel. So everyone had to redesign the website we were not allowed to clone it the site should look totally different from the official hostinger web site we can get inspiration or ideas from the site and have to implement all the features available on the home page.
